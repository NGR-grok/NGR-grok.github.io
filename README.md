# NGR Grok - Static site hosting powered by GitHub   
To host with us, please create a pull request with your site as a directory in /sites/. Then, once reviewed, it will pushed, and your static site will be hosted. To update it at any time, send another PR.   
Alternatively, if you don't have a GitHub account, you can contact us directly and we will review and upload your site manually instead.
